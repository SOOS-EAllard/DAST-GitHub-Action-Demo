# DAST-GitHub-Action-Demo
Setup a commit-triggered DAST scan using SOOS.io

In this demo I will demonstrate:

1 Signing up for a SOOS.io account
2 Getting a client key and an API key from your SOOS account
3 Setting up the aforementioned keys as secrets in GitHub
4 Adding a simple workflow with an action to run SOOS's DAST scan on commit
5 Reviewing the DAST scan results in the GitHub Security tab
